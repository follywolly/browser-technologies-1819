## Setting up for research
I changed the settings in my browser to block all cookies.

## Casually browsing around
One of the first things that stands out when browsing while blocking cookies is that on any site you go on that has a cookie notice, the notice keeps appearing. This makes using such a site usually annoying, since some cookie notices take up a large portion of the screen.

Major news & travel help websites, especially in the Netherlands, are hardly usable if usable at all. Most show a full page size cookie notice.
Some major dutch sites that are usable / partially usable even with cookies disabled:
- [nu.nl](https://nu.nl)
- [HP de tijd](https://hpdetijd.nl)
- [GVB](https://gvb.nl)

Some major dutch websites that don't work without enabling/accepting cookies:
- [ns.nl](https://ns.nl) (doesn't even show feedback that the site became unusable by blocking cookies, shame on you NS!)
- [9292.nl](https://9292.nl)
- [Algemeen Dagblad](https://ad.nl)

Some major websites that don't work without cookies:
- [Facebook](https://facebook.com)
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com)
- [Instagram](https://instagram.com)

Some more finds:
[The NY Times](https://nytimes.com) doesn't seem to use cookies at all. There is no notice of cookies anywhere and the site seems to be working fully even with cookies disabled. The same goes for [Amazon](https://amazon.com).

## Blocking cookies
Most browsers nowadays have settings that allow you to partially or fully block cookies for either first party and third party websites. Most browsers also offer a whitelist and blacklist, to tailor your settings to your needs.
For some reason, microsoft edge only allows you to fully block all cookies or third party cookies.

Another option is to install an adblocker. Adblockers are browser extensions that are specifically developed to disable ads on websites.
One added feature is that they usually block cookies from third parties, so this can generally be a good option for some users.

## Alternatives for cookies
Web SQL (although not really supported anymore)
Webstorage (localStorage / sessionStorage)
IndexedDB
Application Cache
